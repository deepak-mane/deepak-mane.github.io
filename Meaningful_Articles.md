 # Here are 25 easy ways to make your new boss happy. Consultants who work for several clients at once can use these tips to keep multiple “bosses” happy.

We can do the same thing for our co-workers, customers, vendors and anybody else we interact with — and why not?

## 25 Easy Ways To Make Your Boss Happy

1. Get to work a few minutes early, especially when you’re brand-new in the job.
2. Bring a pen and notebook with you on your first day of work, along with any paperwork your new job requires.
3. Take notes. In addition to noting the facts, passwords and instructions you are given, also jot down the names of the people you meet and their roles and contact details.
4. Whenever you meet someone new at work, introduce yourself.
5. When someone helps you out or teaches you something new, thank them sincerely.
6. Check in with your new boss every few days if he or she doesn’t check in with you. If they prefer that you check in via email or text, make that adjustment. Give your manager regular updates on what you’re working on, and  learning.
7. When you have a rough plan for your approach to the role, share it with your boss and get their feedback. Lay out your 30-day, 60-day and 90-day goals. Make sure you and your boss are on the same wavelength.
8. When you have an important conversation with someone at work, send an email message to follow up and confirm what was said. Take the extra second to use “please,” “thank you” and other pleasantries in your messages — it makes a big difference.
9. Resist the urge to tell your co-workers “We handled this task in a much smarter way at my old job!” Wait until you have credibility with your new teammates to suggest improvements, and when you do make recommendations, make them in a positive, “Maybe we could try this!” way rather than by comparing your new shop unfavorably to your old one.
10. Offer to help when someone is stuck, even if your subject matter expertise is low. Just say so. Sometimes people need moral support more than anything else.
11. Set up each work day the night before, at home. Take a moment and plan the following day’s priorities. Whenever you can back out of your “to-do list” mindset and take a broader view of your role, you’ll make important observations.
12. Every weekend, look out over the upcoming week. See what the week has in store for you work-wise and otherwise. Plan your energy expenditures around the shape of the week. Don’t burn yourself out trying to do everything.
13. Guard against the tendency new employees often have to over-commit to initiatives or projects. You don’t know yet how your own job will shift and grow.  You can always offer to be a sounding board, read one document and give feedback or it or take on one other piece of work to help someone out. You don’t have to sign on for the whole production.
14. When you receive positive feedback, pass it on  to your boss. If you start to get a lot of it, ask your boss “Do you want to keep seeing positive messages people send me? I don’t want to annoy you with them but I wanted you to see them if you want.” Some managers would love to see every piece of positive feedback you receive. Even the ones who don’t want to see every glowing review will be pleased to know you’re reinforcing their smart decision to hire you.
15. When appropriate, meet your boss’s boss and introduce yourself. Tell them what your job entails and let them know you’re pleased to have joined the company. Nobody gets enough acknowledgment — not even executives!
16. As much as possible, keep your work area organized and tidy.
17. Notice how your new boss likes to communicate and be sensitive to his or her “open” and “closed” modes. There will be better and worse times to approach your boss, send him or an urgent-reply-needed email message or share an  opinion. Watch for those “open” and “closed” modes and sync up with them as much as possible.
18. Set boundaries politely and professionally over the first few weeks and months in your new job. Maybe one time you will be available to stay late and handle a project and another time, you won’t. Don’t tell your boss or anyone else what personal obligation keeps you from staying late at the office. Simply say “I’m tied up tonight but I could get to that first thing tomorrow. Will that work?”
19. Take special note of dates and deadlines. If you commit to the completion of a task by a certain date, hit the date without fail. If catastrophe strikes and you’re going to miss a deadline, communicate that clearly and as early as possible.
20. Show up to meetings prepared and focused. Don’t bring meals to meetings, unless food is served.
21. Be a conscientious teammate. Don’t talk about personal drama with your co-workers. Don’t crack ice between your teeth or “snap” your gum at work. Don’t cook smelly foods in the microwave.
22. Read the Employee Handbook and sign up for the company benefit plans you want. Get any new-hire paperwork back to the HR, Facilities, IT or Payroll department right away. Don’t make them chase you for it!
23. Err on the side of caution in the dress code department. The more settled in you become, the more creative you may get in your wardrobe choices but as a new employee, don’t push it.
24. Any time you learn something new or create your own procedure, write it down. Most teams wish they had more written instructions and tools than they do. Your FAQ document, teaching aid, step-by-step procedure or other explanatory content may save countless hours and brain cells for someone else in the future!
25. Get a journal and write in it at home. When you start a new job, you’re immersed in a new and different environment. Your senses are wide open then. Write down your impressions. They will serve you later!

Have a great time in the new job and keep growing your flame!


# 7 Ways To Make Your Manager Your Biggest Fan
There are behaviors that some people like, and seek to emulate, that are simultaneously hated by others. I first started to realize this in high school, when boys tended to like some of my behaviors while girls found them crude. These lessons helped me discover which behaviors are socially acceptable while in my youth.  In a similar vein, employees can benefit from knowing the behaviors their manager values most.

 
Managers typically want their employees to be effective at everything. To identify the behaviors that influence them the most, I first looked at a Zenger Folkman dataset of 58,415 leaders. Next, I selected those who had the largest positive difference between how their manager rated them, and how peers and direct reports rated them. I then separated them into two groups: those the manager rated more positively, and those the manager rated more negatively. This analysis revealed some common key issues that tend to be hot buttons for managers. The following seven behaviors are those that managers value most:

### 1. Strategic Perspective. 
Many people think it’s the manager’s responsibility to be clear about the strategy of the organization—setting a strategic direction is not part of most people’s job description. However, managers want direct reports to have strategic perspective before they are required to use it in their job. At Zenger Folkman, we have found that this is the largest skill gap for those rated as having high potential. Do you have a clear perspective about the big picture vision for your organization, while also knowing how your role helps bring about that vision? One way to demonstrate your strategic perspective is to help others clarify and understand the vision.

### 2. Be A Champion Of Change. 
Managers need people to accept change, and are often frustrated by those who resist it. Have the courage to try new things—managers know that mistakes may be made when adapting to changing processes. Challenge some of the standard approaches and independently look for a better way forward.

### 3. Keep Your Manager Informed. 
Managers need to be well informed about their employees’ work and potential problems that may exist. Imagine your manager is discussing a project you are working on with their boss. When asked about your project, your manager boldly says, “Everything is great!” In reality, you had encountered a problem but did not share it with your manager in case it made you look incompetent. The problem with this omission is that now your manager looks incompetent—and it’s your fault. Providing your manager with quick progress reports will have a lasting impact on creating a positive relationship.

### 4. Show Some Energy And Be An Inspiration. 
Mood matters a lot at work. Just like the flu, the mood can spread to others—research has shown that even a person’s happiness is contagious. Cynics or pessimists are less likable. If you complain about having extra work to do, then chances are you are not your manager’s favorite direct report. If you are overwhelmed with work it is often because your boss has given you a stretch goal, which should be viewed positively!

### 5. Take Initiative And Deliver On Your Commitments. 
Be the direct report that sees the mess and cleans it up. When there is an unexpected problem, fix it. When you are behind schedule on your work, stay late and catch up. Be willing to move mountains to deliver on commitments. Managers love direct reports who take initiative, and become frustrated when they must point out every mess and problem.

### 6. Be A Problem Solver. 
When some people encounter a problem, they stop what they were doing and take the problem to their manager to solve. Managers love direct reports that can anticipate potential problems. Researchers have found that if people take some time to consider what might go wrong with a project, they are very good at anticipating and avoiding problems. When you encounter a problem, come up with potential solutions before taking it to your manager.

### 7. Be A Trusted Team Member. 
Have you ever been part of a team where you loved to come to work, enjoyed being with your fellow team members, and the team was highly productive? Conversely, have you ever been part of a team where you hated coming to work, there was conflict, and it was hard to get work accomplished? One of the most challenging aspects of your manager’s job is resolving conflict between team members.  If you have constant problems with your colleagues, chances are your manager does not like you. Be a team member who pulls the team together, not apart.

As you read through the list, you may have identified one to two items you could do to make your manager your biggest fan. Write them down and generate a goal. Set an appointment with yourself once a week to review your progress. Identify people who seem to be talented in those areas and ask them for some coaching. It takes time and reminders to break bad habits, but as your abilities in these areas strengthen, so will your relationship with your manager.
